## 📚 Lessons

A number of important skills i've picket up during this project include a better understanding of some ideas.

### 🧠 `clarifai AI` API:

- **Utilizing API's**: Using the `clarifai face-recognition API` taught me about reading documentation to send and request third party services in an efficient way to enable ease with user interaction of the app.

### 📏 Node.JS with Express:

- **Node.JS**: I've understood the knowledge of server side rendering and routes creation to serve performant front end code requests wit express framework.

### 🗄️ Database:

- **PostgreSQL**: Utilizing a database to save and retrieve user information on the backend helped me understand the inter coherence with the front end.
